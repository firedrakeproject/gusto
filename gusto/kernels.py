"""
This module provides kernels for performing element-wise operations.

Kernels are held in classes containing the instructions and an apply method,
which calls the kernel using a par loop. The code snippets used in the kernels
are written using loopy (https://documen.tician.de/loopy/index.html)

Kernels are contained in this module so that they can be easily imported and
tested.

    Limits the vertical midpoint values for the degree 1 temperature space.

    A kernel that copies the vertex values back from the DG1 space to a broken,
    equispaced temperature space, while taking the midpoint values from the
    original field. This checks that the midpoint values are within the minimum
    and maximum at the adjacent vertices. If outside of the minimu and maximum,
    correct the values to be the average.
