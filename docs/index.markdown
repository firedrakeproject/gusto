Gusto is a code library for building the dynamical cores at the heart of numerical weather prediction and climate models. It is written in Python and specialises in solving the equations describing geophysical fluids using compatible finite element methods. Gusto is built with the [Firedrake](http://firedrakeproject.org) finite element code generation software.

### Gusto is designed to provide:
- a testbed for **rapid prototyping** of novel numerical methods
- a **flexible framework** for exploring different modelling choices for geophysical fluid dynamics
- a **simple environment** for setting up and running test cases
