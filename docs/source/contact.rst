Getting in touch
================

Should you wish to get in touch with the Gusto development team, for
help, feature requests, bugs, or just to say hello, you can do so in a
number of different ways.

Mailing list
------------

Gusto does not currently have a separate mailing list, but you can
contact the entire development team on the Firedrake mailing list:
firedrake@imperial.ac.uk.  Note that you must be subscribed to this
list to post to it.  To do so, visit `this page <mailing_list_>`_.

Issues and feature requests
---------------------------

The best place to submit bug reports or feature requests is on the
`github project page <github_>`_.  We're happy to accept third-party
contributions to Firedrake, but please read the Firedrake `contributing
guidelines <contributing_>`_.

IRC
---

Much of the day to day development discussion for Gusto specifically,
and Firedrake generally, take place on `IRC`_.  You can find us in the
``#firedrake`` channel on `Freenode`_ (``irc.freenode.net``).
